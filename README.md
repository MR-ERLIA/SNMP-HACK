This is the script I mentioned, and for the sake of showing off, I put a Word file named `st.txt` in it. But you can still replace it with your own file or even use the address of a different file.

Note:
Option 1 is SNMP enumeration, and Option 2 is related to brute-forcing the community string.

The use of this tool is your responsibility and has nothing to do with me
